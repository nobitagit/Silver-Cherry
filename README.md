#Silver Cherry

Silver Cherry is a free WordPress Responsive theme built on Zurb's Foundation and the Reverie Framework.
Built in HTML5 & CSS3 this theme was developed as a skin to [Pixelite](http://www.pixelite.me) blog, where you can see it live in action.

The main focus here is on content and readability. On *any* screen size.

##Main features
The theme view uses two main **media queries**, one for wide viewports (768px and above), and one for smaller viewports (767px and under). You can also test the behaviour by shrinking your browser window.

The extremely low number and weight of images used for developing makes it even more mobile-friendly.
Images added to posts shrink to adapt to viewport on resize events.

##Layout
Silver Cherry features a right widgetized sidebar which stacks under the main section in mobile view.


##Menu
The main menu is mostly developed in CSS3 and allows the user to nest up to three levels in depth.
Javascript is only used to increase accuracy when displaying on smaller screen sizes and to allow toggling.

##Typography 
Fonts are sized in *rem* with fallback in *px*, and thought for easy customisation by human beings. If you want to read more on this topic then [here](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem) you go.

Site title and Headings use Lobster and Homenaje from Google Fonts.
